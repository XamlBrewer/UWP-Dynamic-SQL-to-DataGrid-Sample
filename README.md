# UWP-Dynamic-SQL-to-DataGrid-Sample
Demonstrates how to display the result of a SQL Server query in a UWP DataGrid. The app hosts 3 different queries against a SQL Server database, and only one instance of the Windows Community Toolkit DataGrid.

The sample covers the following:
* connecting to a SQL Server database from UWP,
* reading a dynamic TSQL statement into a DataTable,
* modifying the content of the DataTable progammatically,
* binding the DataTable to a DataGrid,
* implementing sort on header click in the DataGrid, and
* maybe more...
